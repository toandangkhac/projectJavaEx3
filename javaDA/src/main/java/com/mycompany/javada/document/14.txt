Tan and Lang
Once upon a time, in the reign of King Hung Vuong IV. I have two friends who are very dear to each other
together. The older brother's name is Tan and the younger brother's name is Lang. Two people with faces and stature
are similar, so many people confuse who is me and who is me.
After his parents died, he sent 2 friends to study with the Liu family. The Liu family has a daughter
The girl has come of age. The girl fell in love with her brother. Since Tan got married, although still
spoiled his younger brother, but the time he spent with his wife was more, so Lang became sad.
Once, the sister-in-law mistakenly recognized her brother as her husband, so she hugged him wrongly after Lang got out
copper back. From then on, Lang was embarrassed to leave the house, went to the stream, couldn't cross, then sat down
cried and turned to stone. My brother Tan, out of love for you, also left to find you,
went to the stream, couldn't get over it, sat down beside the rock and cried and turned into
upright palm tree.
The wife stayed at home and waited for her husband for a long time and didn't come back, so she left to look for it and went to the stream
When she passed, she sat next to the areca tree and cried and turned into a betel nut wrapped around the areca tree.
Betel nut, areca, and lime when mixed together create a blood-red color, so in the future there will be a king
Last week, heard the story above and taught our people to use 3 kinds of lime, areca and betel
make the image of the close friendship between teammates and husband and wife forever never leave.
