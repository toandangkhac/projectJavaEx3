Toad sues heaven
Once upon a time, in an unknown year, the weather caused a terrible drought, and month after month, the sun burned down trees, drained rivers and lakes. Species not a drop of
 water to drink. The big and powerful animals that used to do great work
 in the forest all lay with their tongues out and breathed to wait for death,
 no one could think of any plan to save themselves, save all species. Their power is only
 to bully each other, but they can't do anything to god. Only the small, ugly purple Toad
 guy has big guts. He plans to go to heaven to sue God for rain to save all species.
