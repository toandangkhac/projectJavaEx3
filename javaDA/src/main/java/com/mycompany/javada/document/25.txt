two axes
Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter boy whose parents were very ill and died early,
He had to live an orphan since childhood and his inheritance was only an ax. Every day you have to
carry an ax into the forest to cut firewood and sell it to earn money to live on .
At the edge of the forest there is a very fast flowing river, if someone slips and falls into the river
very difficult to swim to shore. One day, as usual, the woodcutter carried an ax into the forest to cut wood,
While cutting firewood by the riverbank, unfortunately his ax broke its handle and blade
the ax fell into the river.
Because the river flows too fast, even though he knows how to swim, he still dares not go down to find it
ax blade. Desperately he sat crying and complaining. Suddenly there was an old man with white beard and white hair
Gentle eyes Open in front of him, the old man asked and he told the story to the old man
listen .
The old man said he would help him get his ax back. The first time the old man picked up the silver ax, the young man
honestly no, the second time is a golden ax, he also honestly said no. Last time at the beginning
was an iron ax, the young man gladly accepted it.
The old man praised the woodcutter for being honest and honest, so he always promoted 2
gold and silver ax for him. He thanked the old man and took charge happily.
