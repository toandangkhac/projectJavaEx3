The teacher checks the student's IQ.
The teacher asked: "Who is the child of your parents, but not your biological brother?" Ti pay
said: "That's me, Ti". The teacher is very satisfied.
When it was Teo's turn, the teacher also asked: "Who is the child of your parents but not a sibling?
mine?". Teo scratched his head and scratched his ears: "Let me go home and think."
When he got home, he couldn't think of anything, so he went to ask him: "Who is your parent's child but not?
Is that your sibling?". Tieu immediately replied: "That's Tio, who else is there?"
The next day, Teo excitedly went to class to show off to the teacher like a nail: "I know who it is,
that's you Tio." The teacher muttered: "Why is that, it must be Ti, right?".
