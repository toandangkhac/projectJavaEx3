The story of the bundle of chopsticks
Once upon a time, there was a house where a father lived with his four sons. All four friends
healthy, wise, industrious. But dads are always bored because they don't know
beloved, caring for each other, one person often slanders and disparages the other and vice versa.
One day, the father called his children. He held a bundle of chopsticks in his hand and said to his children: "Who is in?
If you break this bundle of chopsticks, I will reward you.” But not one of the four sons
can completely break this bunch of chopsticks. So the father took the chopsticks one by one
and break easily.
The four children all objected because breaking them one by one was too simple. The father then said "Yes
position ! You guys are right, it's easy to break if you split it up, but if you put your strength together
No one can completely break it”.
You must know how to love, unite and take care of each other, then our family's home will be day by day
a stronger one. From then on, his four children all listened to their father's teachings, more and more
unite .
