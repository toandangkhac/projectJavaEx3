The fairy tale of Mrs. Hang
Once upon a time, on the edge of the forest, there was a woodcutter who specialized in 
cutting bamboo trees, bunching them and bringing them to the market to sell to earn a 
living.
One day, he was surprised to see a bright ring around the bamboo he had just cut. Looking 
up, he saw a baby the size of a finger crying. My face is as bright as the moon. The 
woodcutter immediately took it home to raise him, because he had no children. Uncle named 
the baby Hang Nga.
Since raising baby Hang Nga, every day she goes to the forest to collect firewood, 
she also picks up scattered gold coins.

Hang Nga grew up extremely beautiful. Her body was bright and smooth, her skin as white 
as snow, her eyes black and her lips as red as a ripe fruit.
When Hang Nga was 16, there was not a day without boys bringing gifts of pearls and ivory 
to her, asking to marry her. But she adamantly refused.
