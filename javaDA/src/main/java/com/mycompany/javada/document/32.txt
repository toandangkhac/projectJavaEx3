two generations
A young man meets an old man. Proudly wanting to show off his superiority, man
then invited:
You and I compare knowledge by quizzing each other!
The old man hesitated, so he put more conditions:
If you win you get 10 coins, if you lose you only lose 1 coin!
Agreed, you go first.
Who went to space first?
The old man did not answer, quietly withdrew a 1 dollar bill to pay the young man. Okay, he continued:
Who invented the law of conservation of mass?
Bear. One more sheet.
Well, you have asked a lot of questions. His first question to me was not puzzle?
Agree!
What goes up a hill with 2 legs and goes down a hill with 3 legs?
After thinking for a long time, the young man decided to pull out a 10 dong bill, give it to his opponent and
ask again:
Don't know! So what's your child?
The old man quietly pulled out the 1 dollar bill and gave it to the young man.
