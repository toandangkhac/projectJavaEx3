Thieves teach students
Once upon a time there was a skilled thief. The old man felt that he was old and weak, 
so he wanted to pass on the secret of "climbing the wall" to a few disciples. There were 
many people who came to apply for admission, but for everyone he forced a condition that 
he had to undergo a test by going to "eat dew" with him for one night to show him how 
brave he was before he would teach.
There's a guy in the commune whose name is Get brought a chicken raspberry to apply to 
study. Seeing him seem stupid, slow, the old thief did not want to accept. But because 
he kept insisting so fiercely, the old man said: – “All right! You come here tonight, 
let's go on a trip together. How will it be good”.
That night, the teacher told the students to dress up neatly and then lead each other 
to the next village. After cutting the hedge, the two sides sneaked into a certain house.
 The teacher leaned in to his student's ear: “This is a widow's house. His house sells cloth. 
Today they are all gone, only one daughter is taking care of the house. The cloth cover is left at 
the head of the bed, you are free to choose."
Then the teacher cut the wall for the students to get in. Found a place to store the 
fabric. But while he was groping to distinguish the value of each plate, he suddenly 
heard outside the gate shouting: – “There is a thief! There's a thief!" He was out of his 
mind, trying to find a way to get rid of himself, but the girl woke up and hugged him. He 
resisted, but the girl promptly grabbed his bun that had just come out, and at the same 
time cried out very loudly for help.
