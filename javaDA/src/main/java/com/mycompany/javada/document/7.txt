Humans are greedy for talent, Birds are greedy for food
Once upon a time, there were two brothers, both parents died. They live in the same house. 
The older brother is greedy, while the younger brother is somewhat foolish. Then the 
brother got married. Like her husband, the woman is both greedy and cruel. Not wanting 
to let her live with her, the couple decided to divide the inheritance, under the pretext 
that everyone should take care of their own fate.
When dividing the property, they took all the valuable property left by their parents, 
leaving only a small house with a few bad fields. But the younger brother was not envious, happily taking his share. He plows hard. Without seed, he went to his brother's house to beg for a loan. The couple agreed to lend, but before delivering the rice to the younger brother, the woman boiled it all. The younger brother accidentally sowed. And so the grains of rice did not germinate, except for one, because it was left in the pot and did not boil. Seeing that the rice did not grow, the younger brother was very sad, but did not know what to do. He had to bring the only seedling to plant in the field. The guy takes care of watering and catching worms for rice. Unexpectedly, the rice plant grew taller and taller every day. It exceeds the head of a person, the root radiates countless branches. Gradually it became as big as a big tree, the flowers bloomed and covered the whole field. The guy was so happy that he couldn't say it, and every day he watered and didn't leave. When the rice is ripe, he stays out in the field to guard. Suddenly, one day, an eagle swooped down next to his rice plant and 
pecked it. Regretting the effort to cultivate, he rushed to fight with the bird with a 
stick. The bird suddenly said loudly: "Don't hit me, I will repay you if I eat it!". The 
guy stopped and asked: "How to repay?"
