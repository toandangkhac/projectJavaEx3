Maternity delivery
There is a midwife who is quite skilled but often loses her temper. They called her to help a baby give birth
So, coming with a toolbox in hand, she said to her husband:
- Invite him out, I will call if I need anything.
The mother started screaming. About 10 minutes later, she stuck her head out the door and said:
- Do you have pliers?
- Huh?! The husband asked eyes.
– Yes, pliers, hurry! No fuss, I know what I have to do.
With the pliers, about 5 minutes later, she reappeared at the door:
– Do you have a big wrench?
- Wrench? Oh God, what has happened to votoi?
– Well… it's okay, but I need a wrench.
The husband looked wistfully at the wrench and reluctantly handed it to her. The door closes,
the sound of metal colliding with each other, creaking… safe. The husband outside gritted his teeth,
pale face, trembling limbs. After a while, panting, sweaty, Mrs
poked his head out the door and shouted:
– Listen, find a sledgehammer right away, if you are late, you won't be able to lose it!
At this point, the husband couldn't stand it anymore, he pushed the door and burst in, in front of him was the floor
strewn with pliers, hammers… and unopened toolboxes.
