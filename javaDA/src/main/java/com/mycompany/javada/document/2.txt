Black Goat and White Goat
Black Goat and White Goat live in the same forest. Every day, the two often come to drink water and find food in the familiar forest.

One day, the White Goat went looking for something to eat and drink from the spring as usual. The goat was engrossed in gnawing the grass, when suddenly a wolf jumped out from somewhere.

The wolf shouted: - Goat! where are you going?

The white goat cowered in fear, stammering:

- Yes, yes, I'm looking for... to find young grass and... and drink spring water!

The wolf shouted again:

- What do you have on your feet?

- Yes, yes, my feet have nails...!
