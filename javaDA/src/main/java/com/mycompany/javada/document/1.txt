Magic Apple Tree
Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a magic apple tree that grew on 
the outskirts of the city. Every day the children used to come and play there, 
playing around the apple tree and plucking delicious apples from the branches to share 
with each other.
One day a boy came from nowhere, the boy frowned and said to the children:
- Hey guys, this garden is mine, I bought it before. This apple tree is mine, you guys 
go somewhere else to play, don't come here anymore.
Hearing that, the children were very sad, they all bowed their heads and left quietly, 
leaving only the overbearing boy left.
