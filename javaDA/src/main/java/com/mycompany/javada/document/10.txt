The story of the Buddha and Guanyin
Once upon a time, there was a king who gave birth to his first two daughters in a row. 
Having no son, the king worried that he would not have a successor, and day and night 
prayed to God and Buddha for the queen to give birth to a son. But when the third child 
was born, it was still a girl. The king took the third name and gave it to the youngest 
princess, angry at the gods for not helping him achieve his wish. Life expectancy was high,
the king wanted the third princess to get married, intending to pass the throne to the 
concubine.
Contrary to the two sisters Dieu Thanh and Dieu Am, Princess Ba did not immerse herself 
in the golden palace, but became enamored with the chanting of verses, then devoted 
herself to Buddhism. She refused to marry, angered the king and queen, and imprisoned her 
in the back garden of the palace.
 One day the king and queen were out, princess Ba ran to meet the faraway price to visit. 
The king told her to give up her intention to practice for a hundred years, but she still 
refused, and asked her father's permission to become a Buddhist monk. The king pretended 
to comply with his son's will, let her go to the Bach Tuoc pagoda and ordered the bribed 
monks to advise Princess Ba to return to the palace to get married. If it doesn't work, 
the temple will be burned down and all the monks and nuns will be beheaded.
