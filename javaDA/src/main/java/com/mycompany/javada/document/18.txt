Contractual pay eat gold
Once upon a time, there were two friends who lost their parents but their greedy brother was still alive
My brother is gentle and diligent. The older brother took his wife out to live separately and took all his possessions, just to
left a star fruit tree in the garden. The younger brother who shared the inheritance didn't say a word
complained, set up a hut near the star fruit tree.
Every day, the younger brother fertilizes star fruit trees and works as a wage earner to support himself. The star fruit tree keeps growing,
that year was suddenly full of fruit. So I'm very happy. One day, suddenly there was a strange bird from
where to fly to the star fruit tree and eat the star fruit of the younger brother. Seeing this, the younger brother sadly complained to the bird.
The strange bird replied, "Eat a piece of fruit, pay a lump of gold, sew a three-gang bag to carry it." The next day
like a bird's promise to pick up the younger brother to an island full of gold, silver, and treasures. Person
I looked at the island from above and filled my bag with gold and rode it alive
back of the bird.
The younger brother went home to use that gold and silver to build a spacious house and raise more livestock
for farming and animal husbandry. The brother who came to visit was curious and asked where the gold and silver came from
yes, the honest brother told the beginning and the end of the story. The greedy brother demanded to change the star fruit tree
of the younger brother.
The younger brother agreed to change it for me. The brother also met a strange bird to eat star fruit, but due to
greed to sew big bags and take too many gold and silver treasures, so on the way back, strange birds
tired wings threw him into the sea, along with that bag of gold and silver treasures.
